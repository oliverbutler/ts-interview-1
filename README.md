# TS Interview 1

By @oliverbutler

## Task

You and the interviewer are colleagues working on a project together. You stumble upon this big of code that you need to understand - you decide to pair program on it to clean it up and make it more readable.

You can expect that this `SalaryCalculator` class will be used in a larger application, so you may want to consider what type of changes you might not want to make to it.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo
2. `pnpm install`
3. `pnpm test` to run the tests
